 ## Day 1:
 
 Morning Meeting:
In the morning, Abdullah, Nair, and Juli gathered for a meeting. During this meeting, they discussed the database and the application's structure, aiming to adapt them so that users can act both as buyers and sellers simultaneously.

Furthermore, there was a discussion about giving the project's website a specific theme. After considering several options, they reached a consensus, which was later confirmed in an afternoon meeting. The chosen theme for the website was video games.

Afternoon Meeting:
In the afternoon, Abdullah, Nair, and Alejandro convened. During this meeting, they updated the rest of the team on the morning's discussions. They also finalized the website's theme and adjusted the database accordingly. Product categories were created, with the option to modify them in the future if necessary.

With the theme and structure decided, team members present searched for inspirational websites and analyzed the pros and cons of various options, including sites like Eneba, Vinted, Milanuncios, Wallapop, Shpock, Troc, olx, Gumtree, etc.

In addition to the above, possible new endpoints for the backend were proposed, and priorities were assigned to both these new endpoints and the ones already defined. It was decided that each team member would self-assign tasks, which would be listed as "In Progress" while being worked on and moved to "Done" once completed. When sprint deadlines were determined, maximum delivery dates would also be assigned to ensure tasks fit within the sprint timelines. All of this would be managed using the Trello platform.

To conclude the day's meeting, a brainstorming session was conducted to suggest possible names for the website. The goal was to lay the groundwork for the next full team meeting.
