 # Meeting Diary
 
 ## Day 1:
 
 Morning meeting:
 
 In the morning, Abdullah, Nair, and Juli gathered. They chatted and discussed the database and application structure. It was mentioned that it would be interesting for the project's web to have a specific theme. Among the themes mentioned, the one that resonated with everyone and was confirmed in a subsequent afternoon meeting was the theme of Video Games.
 
 Afternoon meeting:
 
 In the afternoon, Abdullah, Nair, and Alejandro met. In the first part, the rest of the team was updated on the morning discussions.
 
 In the second part, the web theme was defined and the database was adapted to it. Product categories were created, with the possibility of modifying them later if necessary.
 
 With this decided, the team members present searched for websites that could serve as inspiration and analyzed the pros and cons of the options considered.
 
 Based on all the previous discussions and decisions, possible new endpoints for the backend were proposed and assigned priority, both for the new ones and the ones already defined. It was decided that each team member would self-assign tasks, which would be listed under the "In Progress" tab while being worked on, and once completed, moved to the "Done" tab. When the sprint deadlines are determined, a maximum delivery date will also be assigned to ensure that the work falls within the sprint timelines. The Trello platform was used for all of this.
 
 To conclude the day's meeting, possible names for the web were suggested through brainstorming, with the aim of establishing a foundation for the next meeting with the entire team, where a relatively definitive name can be decided.
